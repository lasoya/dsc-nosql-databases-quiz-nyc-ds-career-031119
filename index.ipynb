    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",

    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "A SQL data is a relational database management system (RDMS), which holds data in tabular form usually across different tables. In order to obtain information needed for analysise a SQL query is done which can look for the information through multiple tables linked through relationships. A NoSQL database is a database that does not use SQL and is used for holding \"unstructured\" data or non-tabular data. Neither is better than the other. It depends on the situation to determine which is better.\n",
